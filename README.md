# VoidFiller
VoidFiller is a technology‑focused Minecraft mod developed with an engineering‑driven approach to architecture, system design, and scalability.
The mod is built using Java + NeoForge and is designed as an expandable ecosystem of machines, energy systems, materials, and infrastructure.
The project is developed as an engineering‑oriented pet project / portfolio project, with a strong emphasis on code quality, modularity, and architectural clarity.

## Vision
### The goal of this project is to explore and implement:
- Scalable Minecraft mod architecture
- A custom energy system (Void Energy)
- Infrastructure for machines and pipes
- An expandable material and progression system
- A modular and extensible architecture
- Support for various mechanics (structures, mobs, world generation) that have already been implemented
### VoidFiller is designed as a foundation for future technological systems.
